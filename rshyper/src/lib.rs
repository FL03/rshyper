//!
//! ***
//!
//! Welcome to the `rshyper` crate - a Rust package providing a comprehensive framework for
//! creating, manipulating, and analyzing hypergraphs using a myriad of mathematical and
//! algorithmic techniques. The crate is designed to be flexible and modular enabled via heavy
//! feature-gating throughout the framework.
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! Before diving in to the technical side of things, let's start by defining several terms
//! commonly used in the definition and implementation of hypergraphs.
//!
//! ### Terms
//!
//! - **edge:** a hyperedge is a generalization of an edge in a graph, allowing it to connect
//!   any number of vertices.
//! - **facet:** a facet, or surface, defines a weighted hyperedge composed of one or more
//!   vertices.
//! - **node** a node is a complete _vertex_ in that it is considered to be weighted.
//! - **point:** here, a point is a synonym for a vertex, and is used to define the position of
//!   a vertex within the hypergraph.
//! - **surface:** a surface is a synonym for a facet, speaking to an edge and its associated
//!   weight.
//! - **vertex:** a vertex is an _unweighted_ node defining a point within the hypergraph.
//!
//! ### Hypergraphs
//!
//! A hypergraph is an abstraction of a graph that allows edges to connect any number of
//! vertices. This flexible data-strcture is highly mathematical, yet, extremely useful in
//! many applications such as database design, network analysis, combinatorial optimization,
//! modeling topological spaces, and more.
//!
//! #### _Definition 1:_
//! Formally, a directed hypergraph is a pair `H = (V,E)` where `V` is a set of vertices and
//! `E` is a set of hyperedges. Each hyperedge `e âˆˆ E` is a subset of `V` that can contain
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `hyper_map`: enables the [`HyperMap`] implementation, a hash-based hypergraph structure
//! - `macros`: enables the implemented macros for streamlining graph management
//!
//! ### _Dependencies_
//!
//! **Note:** While the `alloc` and `std` libraries are feature-gated, they are required for
//! anything useful in this crate; both are enabled by default.
//!
//! - `rayon`: enables parallel processing capabilities using the `rayon` crate
//! - `serde`: enables serialization and deserialization of hypergraphs using the `serde` crate
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! For more detailed examples, please refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/FL03/rshyper/blob/main/rshyper/examples).
//!
//! ### _Example 1: Basic Usage_
//!
//! ```rust
//! use rshyper::{HyperMap, IntoWeight};
//!
//! let mut graph = HyperMap::<usize, usize>::undirected();
//! // add some unweighted vertices
//! let v0 = graph.add_vertex().expect("failed to add vertex");
//! let v1 = graph.add_vertex().expect("failed to add vertex");
//! // add a weighted node
//! let v2 = graph.add_node(10.into_weight()).expect("failed to add node");
//! // create some edges using those nodes
//! let e0 = graph.add_edge([v0, v1]).expect("failed to add edge");
//! let e1 = graph.add_edge([v1, v2]).expect("failed to add edge");
//! // create a surface (weighted edge) using the nodes
//! let e3 = graph.add_surface([v0, v2], 5.into_weight()).expect("failed to add surface");
//! ```
